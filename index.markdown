# A Discussion Group of Graduate Students at IMSc

This page contains the details that come out of the discussions held almost every week on Saturday at [IMSc Chennai](https://www.imsc.res.in/). A group of graduate students, primarily from Physics and Computational Biology, participate in the discussion. 

This season will be mainly focused on different aspects of non-equilibrium statistical mechanics.

## Discussions May Include:
* Brownian motion and Langevin Equation
* Fokker-Planck Equation
* Linear Response Theory
* Boltzmann Transport Equation
* Phase-Ordering Kinetics
* Pattern Formation
* Large Deviation Theory
* Stochastic Thermodynamics

## The Upcoming Discussion:
Speaker :      [Rahul Dandekar](https://www.imsc.res.in/rahul_sunil_dandekar)   
Date    :      January 18, 2020, Saturday  
Time    :      16:00  
Venue   :      Room No. 326 or 327
