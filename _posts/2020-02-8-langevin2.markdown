Next will be delivered by [Vinay](https://www.imsc.res.in/~vinayv/). He will extend the discussion on Langevin equation approach to treat nonequilibrium dynamics for a Brownian particle. He will roughly cover following topics:

* Revisit Langevin equation, Fluctuation dissipation theorem and Stokes-Einstein relations
* Diffusion equation: Solving the differential equation
* Diffusion and random walk
* Stochastic differential equation

## Time and venue for the Discussion:
**Time:** Saturday (Feb. 8, 2020), 4:00 PM  
**Venue:** 326/327
