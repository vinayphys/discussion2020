Now a set of talks will be delivered by [Umang](https://www.imsc.res.in/umang_dattani). He will be talking about Langevin equation approach to treat nonequilibrium dynamics for a Brownian particle. His discussion will roughly cover following topics: 

* Solution of Langevin equation
* Fluctuation dissipation theorem and detailed balance
* Stokes-Einstein relations
* Mathematical aspects of a Stochastic Differential equation
* A brief introduction to simulations of Langevin equation
* Types of Langevin equations

## Time and venue for the Discussion:
**Time:** Saturday (Jan. 25, 2020), 4:00 PM  
**Venue:** 326/327
