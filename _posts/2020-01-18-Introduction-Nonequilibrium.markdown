The first talk of this season will be delivered by [Rahul](https://www.imsc.res.in/rahul_sunil_dandekar). 

**Abstract:** I will introduce the concept of non-equilibrium and map out the various avenues of study in very brief, and then take analyse one concrete example from the two broad divisions in nonequilibrium statmech: (a) the asymmetric exclusion process, as an example of a NESS (non-equilibrium steady-state), and (b) relaxation to equilibrium in the Ising model, as an example of, well, relaxation.

## Time and venue for the Discussion:
**Time:** Saturday (Jan. 18, 2020), 4:00 PM  
**Venue:** 326/327
